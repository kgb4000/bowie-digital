    question: 'What is the Cost of SEO?',
    answer:
      "The cost of SEO services can vary, but it generally cost between $700 and $5,000 per month. The cost of SEO depends on your website's size, complexity, and the competitiveness of your industry in your area. It also depends on your website's age and the number of inbound links. Some SEO companies offer SEO packages for as low as $299.00, and others even lower at $199.00 per month. Please don't fall for these low prices. Cheap SEO services rarely ever deliver on their promises. If they do, it's often at such a low level that any benefits are entirely unnoticeable. If you hire an SEO company for $299.00 per month and still don't see any results after six months, that's almost $1800.00 you've wasted. If your competitors are using quality SEO services, they will be outranking you in no time. Cheap SEO services usually don't have the same level of expertise and often use black-hat or spammy techniques that can get your website penalized by Google.",

    question: 'Can You Guarantee #1 Rankings?',
    answer:
      'No SEO expert or consultant can guarantee first place rankings. If anyone makes this guarantee, be cautious. It is a sign that they are inexperienced or plan to take your hard-earned money. There are no guarantees in life. The only security is that your website will perform better than when we started.',
