            <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
            <p>
              SEO (search engine optimization) is the process of improving your
              website for users and search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
              With the search algorithm always changing, you need to constantly
              monitor and update your website to keep up with these changes.

              According to Moz, Google reported over 3,000 improvements to

              When someone searches for your products or services, you want the
              search engines to display your business website and webpages.
            </p>
            <p>
              You also want your company website showing up on the first page of
              the search engine results and not the second or third page.
            </p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>Because the first page of Google gets most of the clicks.</p>

              Although there are many search engines to choose from, Google is
              the search engine marketers use when talking about search engine
              optimization, search rankings, and digital marketing.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>
              Because Google is the most used search engine in the US. It has
              more than 88% of the search engine market, and it is used more
              than any other search engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason Google is the most popular is because of its simple
              interface, and because it is the best at returning the right
              search results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bing, the search engine from software giant Microsoft, has only 5%
              of the market, and Yahoo and DuckDuckGo have nearly 3% of the
              market share each.
            </p>
            <p>More people used Google more than any other search engine.</p>

                SEO is not a one-day or one-month fix and forget it process.

                your SEO campaign. Sometimes you can see results within as
                little as three months, but it depends on the competition in

            <h3>Technical SEO Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              Google, and other search engines, need to crawl and index your
              site. They crawl your website using spiders to analyze each page
              on your website. After crawling your website, your web pages get
              indexed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If Google can&apos;t crawl your website, it cannot index your
              website. If it can&apos;t index your website, you will not rank in
              Google.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of our technical analysis, we make sure that your website
              gets indexed on Google. We also make sure that pages that
              don&apos;t need to be indexed are not indexed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other factors that are part of our technical analysis include:

            <h4>Web Design</h4>
            <p>
              In 2021 and beyond, your customers will expect you to have a
              website with a good design. Investing in a responsive web design
              that looks on both desktop and mobile devices are a must.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              Customers will not spend time on your website if your website is
              slow, hard to read, has a lousy color scheme, and is not clean. A
              website with a bad design will have higher bounce rates which are
              not good for Local SEO.

            <h4>Website Architecture</h4>
            <p>
              Website architecture is how the pages on your website are linked
              together. For good SEO, you want a Flat Architecture.
            </p>{' '}
            <p>
              Having a Flat Architecture means that users and Google spiders can
              reach any page on your website in four clicks or less.

            <p>
              404 errors and broken links give users a bad experience. You could
              have deleted a page or misspelled the anchor text for the link.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a user clicks on a link and the page is not there, it can be
              frustrating. A user will likely not return to your site. Broken
              links and 404 pages are not good signals for rankings.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have broken links on your website, we can find them and fix
              them. We have to tools to scan your entire website.
            </p>
            <h4>Page Speed</h4>
            <p>
              Your page speed is one of the most significant factors for good
              SEO and a ranking factor in Google. Your website&apos;s speed on
              desktops and smartphones can mean the difference between ranking
              on the first page and ranking on the second page.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              Your page speed can also be the difference between customers
              staying on your site or going to your competitor&apos;s site.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your page speed also plays a large role when it comes to
              conversions. According to Google, pages that load faster get
              higher conversions than websites that are slower.

            <h4>Mobile and Responsive Website</h4>
            <p>
              Having a mobile and responsive website is part of good web design
              and is great for SEO and Local SEO. Your customers also expect it.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Hubspot Marketing Statistics, 61% of mobile searchers
              are more likely to contact a local business if they have a
              mobile-friendly site.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don&apos;t have a mobile or responsive website, you will
              lose customers to your competitors that do have mobile sites.
              Google will also penalize your website, and it will not rank high
              in the search.

              to test if your website is mobile-friendly.
            </p>
            <h4>Website Security</h4>
            <p>
              Search engines take web security very seriously. You know if your
              site is secure if it starts with HTTPS, and you see a little lock
              next to your domain name.
            </p>
            <div className="blog-image">
              <img
                src="/images/NotSecure.png"
                className="blog-img"
                loading="lazy"
                alt="Website not secure"
              />
              <em>
                Source: <a>Think With Google</a>
              </em>
            </div>
            <p>
              If your site is not secure, Google will display a &quot;Not
              Secure&quot; notice next to your domain name. An unsecured website
              will not rank high in the search and will deter customers from
              doing business with your business.
            </p>
            <p>
              An unsecured site will also hurt your conversions. Your business
              will lose trust and credibility, and consumers may not come back
              to your website.{' '}
            </p>
            <h4>Sitemap</h4>
            <p>
              Search engines use sitemaps to find the different pages on your
              website. If your site is new, or you don&apos;t have any backlinks
              or external links, Google will use your sitemap to find all the
              pages on your website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without a sitemap, Google will use backlinks and external links.
              If you don&apos;t have any backlinks or other websites linking to
              your website, Google will have a hard time finding your website.
            </p>
            <h4>Google Tools</h4>
            <p>
              Google has two tools that can help you rank higher in the search
              engines.
            </p>
            <p>These tools are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Analytics</li>
              <li>Google Search Console</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Google Console is a tool that you can use to see such things </p>
            <p>
              Google Analytics allows you to analyze the traffic that comes to
              your site.
            </p>
            <p>
              It lets you see how many visitors came to your website, where they
              came from, what day they visited, what pages they visited, and
              even what kind of device they used.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google Search Console is another tool from Google, that lets you
              monitor your website, and also troubleshoot your website&apos;s
              presence in the search results. (

              competitiors that rank higher than you in Google.
            </p>
            <h4>Keyword Research</h4>
            <p>
              Keywords are words or phrases that people enter into the search
              engines to find answers to. They are essential because you can
              appear at the top of the search by choosing the right keywords.
              When we do your competitor analysis, we do keyword research to see
              which keywords and phrases your competitors rank. We also look at
              how much traffic they get from those keywords and use this info to
              determine what keywords you should try to rank.
            </p>

            <p>
              When we do your competitor analysis, we do keyword research to see
              which keywords and phrases your competitors rank. We also look at
              how much traffic they get from those keywords and use this info to
              determine what keywords you should try to rank.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of our competitor analysis, we have a list of keywords
              that you will want to use. We use these keywords on our website to
              rank higher and get more traffic.
            </p>
            <h4>Content Research</h4>
            <p>
              Content is king, and it is invaluable when doing your competitor
              analysis.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              The content on your competitors&apos;s websites is precious. By
              looking at the content on their website, we can see which web
              pages bring in the most traffic and which bring in minor traffic.
              We can use this information to decide what content we will create
              and make our content better and more engaging to increase dwell
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Example. If your competitor has a blog post that is five hundred
              words, you should create a post that is one thousand words. You
              should also add more pictures, graphics, and more videos to keep
              people engaged longer.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should answer the user&apos;ss questions and seek to become
              the authority on the subject.
            </p>
            <h4>Technical SEO Research</h4>
            <p>We do technical analysis on your competitor&apos;s websites.</p>
            <p>
              Besides doing technical analysis on your website, we do it on your
              competitors&apos;s. We do this to see what your competitors are
              doing right and what they are doing better. Then we can determine
              what we need to improve our website.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, their website may be mobile but looks cluttered and
              doesn&apos;st have a lot of content. Their website may also not be
              as fast or have broken links.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can then use this information to make your website looks
              better, runs faster, and all the links work.
            </p>
            <h4>Link Research</h4>
            <p>
              If you want to rank higher in Google, you must have backlinks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Backlinks are links from one website to another. In the case of
              your website, backlinks are links from another website to your
              website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Backlinks are like votes given to your website. The more votes you
              have and the better quality votes from high authority websites,
              the higher you website authority.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our competitive analysis, we count how many backlinks your
              competitors have, and we look at the quality of those backlinks.{' '}
            </p>
            <h4>Local SEO</h4>

              <Link href="/local-seo-maryland">
                <a>Local SEO</a>
              </Link>{' '}
              is the process of improving your website for search engines, your
              location, and your local audience. Although similar to SEO, local
              SEO focuses on improving your website to attract customers in your
              local area.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, if you own an asphalt paving company in Bowie, you
              will want to target customers in Bowie. You will have to target
              local keywords like Bowie, or Maryland, or even Annapolis so that
              you come up in the Local Map Pack.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are several reasons you will want to start a local SEO
              strategy.

              A profile page allows customers to find your business on Google
              Maps and learn more about your company.

              businesses directly through search results.

              searching for your products and services.

              Here are some other reasons why you should create a Google

              Every site you list your business must match. Google uses these
              listings as signals to verify that your business is for real.
              Inconsistent NAP citations will be a red flag for Google and
              therefore hurt your SEO.

            <h2>The Cost Of SEO</h2>
            <p>
              The cost of SEO should differ according to each company&apos;s
              specific needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some companies offer SEO services starting as low as $199.00 a
              month, and other companies advertise services starting at $249.00
              a month.

              prices, your SEO strategy may take years for you to see any
              results or you may not see any results at all.
