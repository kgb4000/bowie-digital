            <h2>What is Local SEO?</h2>
            <p>
              Local SEO is the process of improving your website for users,
              search engines, your location and your local audience. It is a
              type of digital marketing that relies on your business' location
              to bring in customers.
            </p>
            <p>Example.</p>
            <p>
              If someone in Bowie searches for a mechanic shop, the search
              engines already know where that person is using geo-location. The
              search engines will show a list of mechanic shops in the search
              results of mechanic shops in and around the Bowie area.
            </p>
            <p>
              As more and more people use search engines to get information, you
              will want to take advantage of this opportunity as a small
              business owner.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will want to start an SEO strategy so that your business will
              show up in the search engine results when people search for
              products and services you offer.
            </p>

            <h2>What is the Difference Between Local SEO and SEO?</h2>
            <p>
              You've heard the terms SEO and Local SEO, but what is the
              difference?
            </p>
            <p>
              The main difference between SEO and Local SEO is that while SEO
              focuses on optimizing a website for national or global search
              results, Local SEO focuses on optimizing a website for local
              search results.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>
              SEO would be used more by big national brands like General
              Electric, Amazon, Etsy, and Overstock. Businesses like
              restaurants, mechanics, plumbers, dentists, and lawyers in your
              local area are more likely to use Local SEO.
            </p>

              Why is Local Search Engine Optimization Important For Maryland
              Small Businesses?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Today more than ever, your business needs a solid online presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without a solid online presence, your business may continue to
              struggle. You may struggle to get web traffic, rank for relevant
              keywords, or rank high in the search results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without local search engine optimization, your business may be
              relying on paying for:

            <h3>Search Engine Updates</h3>
            <p>
              Another reason that local SEO is important is because search
              engines are changing.
            </p>
            <p>They are always changing.</p>
            <p>
              Google, the most popular search engine globally, makes changes and
              updates a few times a year. (

              ).
            </p>
            <p>Some of Google's changes included:</p>
            <h4>Google Panda</h4>
            <p>
              In February 2011, this Google update targeted websites with weak
              pages with thin content. These websites have pages that are low
              quality and do not provide any in-depth information on the
              subject.
            </p>
            <h4>Google Penguin</h4>
            <p>
              Released in April 2012, this update targeted websites that uses
              link schemes and link buying. It also targeted and penalized
              websites that were keyword stuffing. Keyword stuffing involves
              unnaturally repeating a keyword to fool the search engines and
              make the website appear relevant. (
              <a
                href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/google-penguin"

              ).
            </p>
            <h4>Google Mobile-Friendly</h4>
            <p>
              Released in April 2015, this update boosts the ranking of
              mobile-friendly web pages. This update is important for local
              small businesses because over 46% of all Google searches are
              looking for local information.
            </p>
            <h4>Google Bert</h4>
            <p>
              Released in October 2019, this update targets web pages with
              poorly written content and web pages with low-quality content. It
              also improves the search results and returns better answers to
              questions from searchers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Knowing that Google and the other search engines are constantly
              updating their algorithms should be a significant reason for
              search engine optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your website can be penalized by the search engines without you
              even knowing, and your website may never show up in the search
              results when people search for your products and services.

            <h3>Have consistent NAP</h3>
            <p>NAP stands for name, address, and phone number.</p>
            <p>
              For your local SEO to work, you must include this information on
              your website. This way, it will be easy for people and search
              engines to find your business information.
            </p>
            <p>However.</p>
            <p>
              It must be written the same way on your website and on other
              online directories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Search engines see your NAP consistency as a sign that you have a
              legitimate business.
            </p>
            <h3>Update Online Directories</h3>
            <p>
              Online directories are websites that store information about
              businesses. Information in these directories are the same
              information search engines use to rank your website and show it in
              the search results.
            </p>
            <p>
              Search engines use these directories as a way to validate your
              business.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the major directories you must get your business listed in
              are:
            </p>
            <Stats>
              <li>Neustar Localeze</li>
              <li>Foursquare</li>
              <li>Data Axle</li>
              <li>Yelp</li>
              <li>Facebook</li>
              <li>Bing</li>
              <li>Yahoo</li>
            </Stats>
            <h3>Do a Local SEO Audit</h3>
            <p>
              If you have a website and start local SEO, you must perform an SEO
              audit.
            </p>
            <p>
              An SEO audit will let you discover problems in your website that
              may be keeping you from ranking higher in the search engines.{' '}
            </p>
            <p>An SEO audit will include:</p>
            <Stats>
              <li>A Technical SEO Analysis</li>
              <li>A Competitor Analysis</li>
              <li>A Google Business Profile audit</li>
              <li>On page SEO checks</li>
              <li>Off page SEO checks</li>
              <li>A Citation audit</li>
            </Stats>
            <p>
              Starting an SEO audit will teach you that you need to track
              important elements of your website.
            </p>
            <p>
              To track your website's performance, you will need to connect
              Google Analytics and Google Search Console to your website.{' '}
            </p>
            <h3>Create Local Content</h3>
            <p>Local content is crucial for local SEO to be successful.</p>
            <p>
              Creating local content lets search engines know that you are a
              local business and that you are involved in the community.
            </p>
            <p>For example.</p>
            <p>
              Our Maryland SEO company gives free advice to small businesses on
              using SEO to grow their business with our blog. On our blog we
              post articles on things we believe will help small businesses use
              and understand SEO, plus other helpful stuff.
            </p>
            <h3>Community Participation</h3>
            <p>
              When you become involved in your local community, you can create
              opportunities for links and mentions from local news outlets and
              bloggers. This can help to improve your online visibility and
              increase your ranking in the local listings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, businesses that are active in their local community
              often see an increase in website traffic and conversions, as well
              as customer loyalty. This is because consumers are more likely to
              do business with a company that they know and trust.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, being active in the community can help businesses
              generate leads. This is because there is a higher chance of
              potential customers stumbling upon the company’s website or blog.
              And, if they like what they see, they may decide to contact the
              business for more information.
            </p>

              start seeing results.
